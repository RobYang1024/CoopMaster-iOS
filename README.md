# CoopMaster-iOS
Chicken Egg Counter and Water/Food Consumption grapher application. Initially conceived at Cornell's Animal Health Hackathon January 2017 by the "Coop Masters" team, consisting of Danny Yang, Larry Tang, Eric Tang, Robert Yang, and Eric Lei. iOS app coded by Robert Yang and Eric Lei in XCode.

This application utilizes the SwiftChart library for graph generation, which you can find here:
https://cocoapods.org/?q=swiftchart

For data storage, the application uses NSUserDefaults.

The purpose of this application is to facilitate the logging process for small scale chicken coop owners. That is to say, this application helps chicken owners keep track of egg production, water consumption, feed consumption, etc.

Unfortunately, the only graph that currently works is the egg production graph, as there are issues with scrolling that I will resolve at a later time.

The Android version of the application, coded by Danny Yang, Larry Tang, and Eric Tang, can be found here:
